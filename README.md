A blockchain-based NFT battle platform that combines AI-generated artwork with strategic turn-based combat. Built on Polkadot AssetHub with smart contract integration via PolkaVM.

**Live Demo:** [vulpix.rex.wf](https://vulpix.rex.wf)

## Overview

Vulpix is a decentralized application (dApp) that enables users to create, manage, and battle with AI-generated NFTs across multiple blockchain networks. The platform leverages Polkadot AssetHub for NFT ownership and storage, while utilizing Ethereum-compatible smart contracts through PolkaVM for battle logic execution.

Key features include AI-powered NFT artwork generation, strategic turn-based battles, and comprehensive digital asset management through a modern, responsive web interface.

## System Architecture

![System Architecture](.github/assets/01.png)

The platform is built on several interconnected subsystems:

| Component | Technology | Primary Function |
|-----------|------------|------------------|
| Frontend Application | Next.js 15.3.3 | User interface and client-side logic |
| Backend Services | Convex | Real-time database and serverless functions |
| Blockchain Integration | Polkadot API, Ethers.js | Multi-chain wallet and contract interaction |
| AI Image Generation | Google AI SDK | NFT artwork creation and processing |
| Storage Layer | Vercel Blob, Pinata IPFS | Decentralized and centralized asset storage |

## Data Flow Architecture

![Data Flow Architecture](.github/assets/02.png)

The platform operates on a reactive architecture where user interactions trigger cascading updates through the provider hierarchy, backend functions, and ultimately to persistent storage layers. Real-time synchronization ensures that all connected clients receive immediate updates when system state changes occur.

## Backend Architecture

![Function Module Architecture](.github/assets/04.png)

Convex serves as the primary backend platform, providing a serverless function runtime with integrated document database, real-time subscriptions, and automatic API generation. The backend is organized into six main function modules that handle different aspects of the platform's functionality.

Function modules are automatically exposed through the generated API layer, providing type-safe access from frontend components. Each module contains query functions for reading data and mutation functions for updates, all with real-time subscription capabilities.

## Core Features

### AI Image Generation

The AI-powered image generation system allows users to create custom NFT artwork using Google AI models. The system provides a complete workflow from prompt input to NFT creation, with real-time generation tracking and collection management.

![AI Image Generation](.github/assets/05.png)

The system consists of a React-based frontend interface that communicates with Google AI models through Convex backend functions. Users can generate images using text prompts, preview results in real-time, and mint the generated images as NFTs in their AssetHub collections.

### Battle System
- **Turn-based Combat**: Strategic elements with NFT-based character battles
- **Real-time Multiplayer**: Instant updates and battle synchronization
- **Battle Analytics**: Comprehensive history and statistics tracking
- **Smart Contract Integration**: On-chain battle logic execution

### NFT Integration
- **AssetHub Support**: Native support for Polkadot AssetHub NFTs
- **AI-Generated Stats**: Battle statistics automatically generated for each NFT
- **IPFS Storage**: Decentralized metadata and image storage
- **Wallet Integration**: Seamless asset management through Polkadot extensions

### User Experience
- **Modern Interface**: Responsive web design with smooth animations
- **Seamless Wallet Connection**: Integration with popular Polkadot extensions
- **Customizable Profiles**: User profiles with image upload capabilities
- **Battle Lobby System**: Matchmaking and battle organization

## Polkadot and AssetHub Integration

The platform provides comprehensive Polkadot browser extension integration, AssetHub NFT management, and blockchain utilities that enable seamless interaction with the Polkadot ecosystem.

### Extension Integration

The `usePolkadotExtension` hook manages connections to Polkadot browser extensions and provides a unified interface for wallet interactions.

### Account Management

The account management system handles Polkadot account validation, selection, and state persistence. Connection state persists for 24 hours using localStorage and automatically reconnects on page load.

![Address Validation Process](.github/assets/08.png)

```typescript
// Connection state structure
interface ConnectionState {
  connected: boolean;
  selectedAccountIndex: number;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

## Smart Contracts and PolkaVM

The VulpixPVM smart contract serves as the core battle engine, executing turn-based combat logic on-chain while maintaining deterministic battle outcomes. The contract manages battle state, NFT stats, and move history entirely on the blockchain.

### Contract Functions

| Function | Purpose | Modifiers |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| createBattle | Initialize new battle with NFT stats | None |
| executeTurn | Process combat turn and update state | battleExists, battleIsOngoing, isPlayerTurn |
| getBattleState | Retrieve current battle state | battleExists |
| getBattleMoves | Get move history for battle | battleExists |
| getPlayerHealthPercentage | Calculate health percentage | battleExists |

### Battle Mechanics

![Turn Execution Flow](.github/assets/10.png)

**Damage Calculation Algorithm:**
- **Base Damage**: (attack / 5) + (strength / 10)
- **Speed Modifier**: (baseDamage * speed) / (BASE_MULTIPLIER * 5)
- **Tactical Modifier**: (baseDamage * intelligence) / (BASE_MULTIPLIER * 4)
- **Critical Hit Chance**: (luck / CRITICAL_CHANCE_DIVISOR) + 5
- **Type Effectiveness**: Fire > Grass > Water > Fire (50%, 100%, 150% multipliers)
- **Defense Reduction**: (rawDamage * totalDefense) / (totalDefense + 25)

### Transaction Processing

The `handleExecuteTurn` function demonstrates the complete integration pattern:

1. **Optimistic Update**: Update Convex state immediately for UI responsiveness
2. **Wallet Connection**: Initialize ethers.BrowserProvider with window.talismanEth
3. **Contract Interaction**: Create contract instance with VulpixPVMABI and execute transaction
4. **Event Parsing**: Extract TurnExecuted and BattleEnded events from transaction receipt
5. **State Synchronization**: Update Convex with verified blockchain state
6. **Error Handling**: Revert optimistic updates on transaction failure
